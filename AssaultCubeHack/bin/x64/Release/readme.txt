 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

 

 

 OMG ! VIRUS ? 

 Yes certain behaviours of our software might be considered as malicious by your antivirus. They are false positives. Our software is designed to simulate mouse movement and keyboard typing to actually play the game. This is a common trigger for anti-virus engines. In order to work properly, the software is using your network traffic to check if an update is available and to grant full access to premium users. The software is also creating/writing and reading a configuration file in order to save your settings. The software source code is obfuscated to prevent it being easily stolen. This alone is enough to trigger multiple anti-virus engines. If after all you remain unconvinced, dont use this software.

[FR]

Présentation : 

Ce logiciel a pour but de tricher sur un jeu à la première personne.
Le programme utilise la mémoire du jeu afin de lire chaque détail que l'on veut voir à l'écran.
Il permet de visualiser des ennemis à travers les murs et de faire pas mal de modification à l'écran
que cela soit l'interface visuelle ou le jeu en lui même afin de rendre l'ergonomie et l'utilisation du logiciel le plus complet possible.

Objectif personnel :
Ce projet avait été créer dans l'unique but d'apprendre par curiosité.

Ce projet m'a permis de découvrir comment fonctionnait le language machine (assembleur).
Le reverse engineering d'un programme pour modifier ses propriétées.
Création de fonctions qui calculent les angles pour positionner et dessiner correctement, la position, la distance  "matrix", "Vecteur", "AxisAlignedBox".
Utilisation de l'API DirectX et la bibliothèque SharpDX pour créer des formes à l'écran.
